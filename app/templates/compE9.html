    <h1>Mini Challenge #14</h1>

    <h2>Basic Information</h2>
    <strong>Mini Challenge #14</strong>: Too Late for Halloween, Too Early for Xmas<br/>
	<strong>Timeline</strong>: Until 24 December 2023<br/>
	<p>
	    <strong>Description: </strong>Supposed to publish this event in November, so it is exactly between
        Halloween and Xmas, but I guess my lazy side got the best of me and I procrastinated this much.
        Anyways, this will be the first event where I would officially not rate the difficulty of the chart!
	</p>
    <p>
        As a bonus, I would also celebrate the birthday of our November babies by creating a special UCS
        dedicated to the Eleven-th month of the year :D
    </p>
	<strong>Scoring System</strong>: Mr Weq's Phoenix Score<br/>

    <h2>The real UCS will gonna torture you so badly</h2><br>
    <p>In this competition, each of the players will be given two UCS which needs to be played. The stepcharts are to 
        be revealed to the players one day before the competition officially starts (which will be on 12th December).
        Even so, we might provide more details regarding the UCS you might need to encounter, as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>One of the UCS will be Single and another one will be Double</li>
            <li>The single one will be as difficult as S17 and the double one will be as difficult as D15</li> 
        </ul>
        The rulings of the current competition will be as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>The duration for the score submission will be from 13th December to 27th December</li>
            <li>Scoring system will be different from the total score available on the screen. We will calculate the final
                score by calculating the following formula:<br> 
                <b>(perfect + 0.8*great + 0.5*good + 0.1*bad) / (perfect + great + good + bad + miss)</b>
            </li>
            <li>Both scores will be summed and the sum will be used to determine the rank of each player</li>
            <li> Players are allowed to attempt each of the UCS as many as possible within the time period, however 
                only the one with the highest score for each UCS will be calculated towards the final 
            </li>
            <li>Currently, there is no requirement to upload the photo of your scores. However, please fill in the form 
                provided <a href="{{ url_for('score') }}">here</a> honestly. 
            </li>
            <li>
                You need to send the photo of your best achievement (for each UCS, <b>based on the score system applied 
                within this competition</b>) in the WhatsApp group that we have
            </li>
        </ul>
        Lastly, enjoy the competition, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
